Problem 1: Real-Time Weather Monitoring System 
Scenario:    
 You are developing a real-time weather monitoring system for a weather forecasting company. The system needs to fetch and display weather data for a specified location.
Tasks:
1. Model the data flow for fetching weather information from an external API and displaying it to the user. 
2. Implement a Python application that integrates with a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch real-time weather data. 
3. Display the current weather information, including temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed.
 4. Allow users to input the location (city name or coordinates) and display the corresponding weather data.
Deliverables:
1.Data flow diagram illustrating the interaction between the application and the API.  2.Pseudocode and implementation of the weather monitoring system.  
3.Documentation of the API integration and the methods used to fetch and display weather data. 
4.Explanation of any assumptions made and potential improvements.

Pseudocode:
       outline the pseudocode for the weather monitoring system.
1. Start 
2. Prompt the user to enter a location (city name or coordinates) 
3. Read the user input 
4. Format the input into an API request URL 
5. Send an HTTP GET request to the weather API using the formatted URL 
6. Receive the response from the weather API 
7. Parse the JSON response to extract temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed 
8. Display the extracted weather information to the user 
9. End
With this, we can move on to the implementation in Python, integrating with the OpenWeatherMap API.

Implement the Python code:

import requests
def get_weather_data(location):
    api_key = "b11f2fe52244a66eb93ee793f28c2d3b"  
    base_url = "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?"
    complete_url = base_url + "q=" + location + "&appid=" + api_key
    response = requests.get(complete_url)
    return response.json()
def display_weather_data(weather_data):
    if weather_data['cod'] != '404':
        main = weather_data['main']
        wind = weather_data['wind']
        weather_description = weather_data['weather'][0]['description']
        print(f"Temperature: {main['temp']}K")
        print(f"Humidity: {main['humidity']}%")
        print(f"Weather Description: {weather_description}")
        print(f"Wind Speed: {wind['speed']} m/s")
    else:
        print("City Not Found")
if __name__ == "__main__":
    location = input("Enter the city name: ")
    weather_data = get_weather_data(location)
    display_weather_data(weather_data)

OUTPUT:

Enter the city name: Tamil Nadu
Temperature: 300.28K
Humidity: 68%
Weather Description: overcast clouds
Wind Speed: 10.54 m/s
